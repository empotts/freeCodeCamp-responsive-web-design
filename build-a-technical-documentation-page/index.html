            <p> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
                that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
                syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
                runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
                typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

            <p> James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
                Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
                television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
                outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from
                Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that
                system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>
            <p> Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised write once,
                run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and
                featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers
                soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The
                Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0
                language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“
                1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included
                technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME
                featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for
                marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>

                The "Hello, World!" program is a simple and traditional introductory program used to demonstrate the
                basic syntax and structure of a programming language. In Java, creating a "Hello, World!" program
                involves writing a few lines of code. Here's a basic example:</p>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
            }
            </code>

            <p>In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. The data type of a variable determines what
                kind of data it can hold. Here are some basic variable types in Java:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>int: Used to store integer numbers (whole numbers).</li>
                <li>double: Used to store floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).</li>
                <li>boolean: Used to store true or false values.</li>
                <li>char: Used to store a single character.</li>
                <li>String: Used to store a sequence of characters (text).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here are some commonly
                used operators in Java:</p>
            </p>
            </p>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus).
                </li>
                <li>Assignment Operators: = (assign value), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply
                    and assign), /= (divide and assign).</li>
                <li>Comparison Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than),>= (greater
                        than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).</li>
                <li>Logical Operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).</li>
                <li>Increment/Decrement Operators: ++ (increment by 1), -- (decrement by 1).</li>
            </ul>
            <code><code><code><code><code><code>int a = 10;
                int b = 5;
                
                // Arithmetic Operators
                System.out.println("Addition: " + (a + b));
                System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (a - b));
                System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
                System.out.println("Division: " + (a / b));
                System.out.println("Modulus: " + (a % b)); </code></code></code></code></code></code>
